## :technologist: Technologies and metodologies

Technologies and metodologies used in this project:

**HTML / CSS / BEM / RWD / JavaScript /
API i Fetch / Webpack**

In this task, my job was to create platform, where you are able to create an excursion offer as an **admin** and choose excursion as a **client**.

## :mechanic: Admin

The admin panel includes options such as:

- adding excursions (containing its name, description and price per adult/child) to the website and also to the JSON file;

- removing newly created excursions;
- updating excursions data;

The admin panel includes options such as:

- getting excursions from JSON file;
