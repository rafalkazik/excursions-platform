# Excursions platform

## :technologist: Technologies and metodologies

Technologies and metodologies used in this project:

**HTML / CSS / BEM / RWD / JavaScript /
API i Fetch / Webpack**

In this task, my job was to create platform, where you are able to create an excursion offer as an **admin** and choose excursion as a **client**.

## :gear: Installation

The project uses [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). To run the app on your device you should install all dependencies. Then create a localhost port and run your web explorer.

Let's start with installing all dependencies. Move to the app main workspace and run:

    npm i

To create a localhost port you should type:

    npm start

Our repositories search engine is ready at port 8080.

    http://localhost:8080/

## :mechanic: Admin

The admin panel includes options such as:

- adding excursions (containing its name, description and price per adult/child) to the website and also to the JSON file;

- removing newly created excursions;
- updating excursions data;

The admin panel includes options such as:

- getting excursions from JSON file;
